    "The aim of the project is to preliminary test a clustering procedure on multivariate road traffic time series in order to separate different paths between the days of the week and between different months. To create the multivariate time series two fundamental variables are considered the flow $q(t,x)$ and the density $\\rho(t,x)$ . The clustering technique used is k-means with soft-dynamic time warping to compare the series. To see if the clustering technique is able to generalize well traffic dynamics, it is also applied to unseen data (the clustering is train on a specific segment of a road and then tested on a different segment with similar boundary level of flow, density and speed). In order to decide the most suitable number of cluster the silhouette coefficients is computed  as well as a similarity measure between nearest clusters  based on soft-DTW.\n",

    "In section 2 I present the data used, the detectors considered S60 and S1816, the pre-process strategy implemented to treat rough data and normalize them. In section 3 I explain the soft-DTW similarity measure between time series, the k-means algorithm and a set of metrics to evaluate the technique. Then in section 4 the result are showed: Both detectors are used for training the centroids and as test set, the procedure is repeated for different aggregation time and only significant results are showed. Finally in section 5 conclusion and outlook are reported.       "

To reduce their impact on the normalization procedure and on the clustering algorithm  missing values are replaced with substituted values. Generally missing values are created when detectors are out of order, no measure of flow and density are registered for a certain period. To overcome that an imputation process is performed. If for example data on 14/03/2013 at 9:30 are missing the imputation is done by taking the median of the data on 01/03, 07/03, 21/03 and 28/03 at 9:30.
