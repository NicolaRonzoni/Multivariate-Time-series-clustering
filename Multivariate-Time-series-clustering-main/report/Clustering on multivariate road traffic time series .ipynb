    "The aim of the project is to preliminary test a clustering procedure on multivariate road traffic time series in order to separate different paths between the days of the week and between different months. To create the multivariate time series two fundamental variables are considered the flow $q(t,x)$ and the density $\\rho(t,x)$ . The clustering technique used is K-means with soft-dynamic time warping to compare the series. To see if the clustering technique is able to generalize well traffic dynamics, it is also applied to unseen data (the clustering is train on a specific segment of a road and then tested on a different segment with similar boundary levels of flow, density and speed). In order to decide the most suitable number of clusters the silhouette coefficient is computed  as well as a similarity measure between nearest clusters  based on soft-dynamic time warping. Moreover a lower bound for a minimum number of days inside a cluster is fixed to overcome the trade off between interpretability of the clusters and their number.  \n",

In section 3 I explain the soft-DTW similarity measure between time series, the K-means algorithm and a set of metrics to evaluate the technique. Then in section 4 the results are showed: both detectors are used for training the centroids and as test set, the procedure is repeated for different aggregation time and only significant results are presented. Finally in section 5 conclusions and outlook are reported.       "

To reduce their impact on the normalization procedure and on the clustering algorithm  missing values are replaced with substituted values. Generally missing values are created when detectors are out of order, no measure of flow and density are registered for a certain period. To overcome that, an imputation process is performed. If, for example, data on 14/03/2013 at 9:30 are missing the imputation is done by taking the median of the data on 01/03, 07/03, 21/03 and 28/03 at 9:30.

Since the same order of magnitude of the fixed  lower bound ( \\hyperlink{page.8}{see section 3.3}) is reached I do not present K-means algorithm with more than five clusters. By increasing the number of clusters the interpretation of these ones becomes complicated. However by looking at the line plot in Figure 4.29 of the soft-DTW similarity measure between nearest cluster in relation with the number of clusters I can notice that the line flattens after 8 clusters. In S1816 detector the lower bound (minimum number of days in a cluster) is not reached as in S60 detector when the line of soft-DTW similarity measure flattens (see Figure 4.15 \\ref{Fig 4.15}). This behaviour shows that to validate a clustering procedure multiple aspects should be considered such as interpretability of the clusters, distance between them and cohesion inside each of them. \n",

    "Through this project the K-means algorithm with soft-DTW is preliminary tested on multivariate road traffic time series. After having decide a pre-process strategy the main challenge is to decide the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "For both detectors analyzed S60 and S1816, and for both aggregation time considered 6-minute and 30-minute three clusters seems to be a good compromise between quality of the clustering procedure and differentiation of traffic dynamics over a year of time.By applying the centroids trained on a detector on unseen data (the other detector) two clusters is the best choice. 6-minute averages and 30-minute averages data give same result for two and three clusters, by increasing the number of clusters to four and five, despite silhouette coefficients are in the same order of magnitude, clusters of 6-minute averages become harder to interpret or some of them contain too few days with respect to 30-minute averages. Since the K-means algorithm is highly dependent from the traffic analyzed by changing the period of time considered no more one year but for example 6 months, different results are expected both in term of optimal number of clusters and performance regarding the different aggregation time. \n",
